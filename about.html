            <p id="about-me-intro">I attend the University of Health Sciences and Pharmacy in St. Louis. I am a member of the women's basketball team here and I am pursuing a major in biomedical science with a minor in computer science. I am unsure of what my plans are for a future job, but I have a big interest in healthcare as well as research.</p>
            <p id="favorite-hobby">My favorite hobby/interest is playing basketball. I am a member of my school's intercollegiate team and have been playing since I was in 6th grade. I enjoy playing basketball not only because of the sport itself, but also for the friends and relationships I build through being a part of a team.</p>
